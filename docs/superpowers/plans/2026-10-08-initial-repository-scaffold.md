# net*CIRCUIT Remote Initial Repository Scaffold Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create a complete, modular, AI-handoff-friendly initial monorepo scaffold for `net*CIRCUIT Remote`, including architecture documentation, contracts, runnable software shells, FPGA placeholders, deployment templates, tests, CI starters, and a distributable ZIP.

**Architecture:** The repository is a modular monorepo with strict subsystem boundaries: Vue/Vite frontend, FastAPI application backend, Python gRPC hardware service, circuit simulator, FPGA workspace, formal contracts, deployment configuration, and documentation. The software must work at shell/smoke-test level without pretending unfinished hardware functions are implemented; Virtual Hardware precedes Physical Hardware.

**Tech Stack:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, Three.js, Python 3, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, gRPC/Protobuf, SQLite, Nginx, systemd, Verilog HDL, Quartus Prime, GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-net-circuit-remote-architecture-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Main controller: Raspberry Pi 5.
- OS baseline: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit.
- Frontend: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Three.js.
- Application backend: Python + FastAPI + Pydantic + SQLAlchemy + WebSocket.
- Hardware backend: Python + gRPC + Protobuf + Hardware Abstraction Layer.
- Database baseline: SQLite.
- Reverse proxy: Nginx.
- Process management: systemd.
- FPGA prototype target: EP4CE6E22C8N without SDRAM, Experiment Controller only.
- FPGA V1 target: EP4CE10E22C8N.
- External V1 memory: 64 MB SDR SDRAM, 16-bit.
- V1 FPGA philosophy: one FPGA architecture.
- Breadboard target: at least two physical breadboards.
- Physical breadboard holes are not equivalent to independent routing channels or FPGA GPIO.
- Frontend must never access raw FPGA registers or MUX addresses directly.
- Timing-critical hardware operations remain in FPGA.
- Web and Virtual Hardware development precedes FPGA integration.
- Unknown electrical limits, FPGA pinouts, SDRAM part numbers, ADC/DAC part numbers, and timing values must not be invented.
- Unimplemented hardware features must be explicitly labeled placeholder/stub, not represented as working.

## Review Focus

1. **Missing hardware configuration:** the software shell must start without FPGA/SDRAM hardware and report Virtual/Unavailable hardware states cleanly.
2. **Malformed Circuit Graph:** contract validation must reject missing schema version, missing modules, and malformed connection endpoints.
3. **Boundary violation:** frontend source must contain no direct FPGA register or raw physical-routing control interface.
4. **Protocol/version mismatch preparation:** documentation and placeholder protocol structures must reserve explicit version fields rather than relying on application release version.
5. **Context drift:** a new contributor must be able to determine current architecture, current phase, immutable decisions, and next task from the documentation set alone.

---

## Self-Review Result

- **Spec coverage:** repository boundaries, contracts, Virtual/Physical Hardware Station, Web-first gate, FPGA targets, 64 MB SDR SDRAM, documentation lifecycle, CI/testing, deployment, context-drift prevention, and packaging are each assigned to a task.
- **Type/interface consistency:** application-level circuit contract and Hardware Station operation names remain consistent throughout the plan.
- **Review Focus coverage:** no-hardware state is covered in Task 6; malformed Circuit Graph in Task 3/5; frontend boundary violation in Task 4/10; protocol version independence in Task 3; context drift in Task 1/10.
- **Scope:** this plan intentionally scaffolds the repository and runnable shells only. It does not implement the production 3D editor, complete simulator, FPGA Experiment Controller, SDRAM controller, Generator, or Oscilloscope.
