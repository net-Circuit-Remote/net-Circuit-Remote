- `[S]` superseded by a later approved design

## Phase 0 — Project Architecture

- [x] Select Web-first / simulation-first strategy.
- [x] Select modular monorepo boundary.
- [x] Select software stack.
- [x] Select EP4CE6 prototype and EP4CE10 + 64 MB SDR SDRAM V1 direction.
- [x] Create initial repository scaffold.
- [x] Approve **Single Workspace** frontend architecture on 2026-10-09.
- [S] Previous six-page Dashboard/Laboratory/Circuits/Stations/Experiments/Settings UX.

## Phase 1 — Single Workspace Web Foundation

Reusable Phase 1 engineering already exists:

- [x] Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia foundation.
- [x] Typed API layer.
- [x] WebSocket reconnect/lifecycle foundation.
- [x] Six Pinia store boundaries.
- [x] Frontend runtime tests, boundary checks and reproducible build/CI commands.

UI migration completed on 2026-10-09; evidence in `DEV_LOG.md`:

- [x] Replace routed multi-page shell with one `/` Single Workspace shell.
- [x] Remove visible main-page navigation.
- [x] Add application/file-action bar: New / Open / Save / Undo / Redo (local JSON/project history).
- [x] Add top component ribbon with twelve groups and supplied SVG artwork thumbnails; choice-only palettes anchored to their family and single-line labels.
- [x] Add left interaction tool rail with seven shared modes.
- [x] Independently collapse/expand component ribbon and tools sidebar with permanent keyboard-accessible toggles, reclaimed canvas space and scrolling tools at short heights. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-11-collapsible-toolbars-browser.md`.
- [x] Add central workspace shell occupying most of the viewport.
- [x] Add status-bar-right Zoom In/Out/Fit Entire Circuit and Workspace Object Snap with definitions (supersedes Perspective overlay/reset).
- [x] Add bottom simulation status bar with honest unavailable execution controls.
- [x] Add shared floating-window manager: drag/focus/keyboard/clamp.
- [x] Add initial instrument window shells: Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Signal Monitor.
- [x] Add Component Info, Inspector and Memory Hex Editor window shells.
- [x] Retire legacy routed page components after references/tests are migrated.
- [x] Keep API/WebSocket/hardware boundary tests green; verify build and desktop browser layout.

## Phase 2 — Interactive Circuit Workspace

- [x] Three.js scene/camera/lights/grid/models/picking and disposable render/resize/context lifecycle.
- [x] Breadboard/board/power-supply visual models, without invented electrical nodes or sources.
- [x] Canonical metadata-driven palette and generated browser catalog (21 editor types, including visual structures and two-channel Oscilloscope/Function Generator).
- [x] L1571979 two-channel Function Generator visual, reference front layout, silver case, independent screen/encoder/keys/BNCs/stand, shared GLB/glTF/PNG/SVG export and existing Move/Rotate/gizmo/Undo-Redo integration. DDS output remains later work; see `apps/web/public/models/function-generator-2ch/README.md`.
- [x] Two-channel Oscilloscope bench visual with a silver enclosure, wide screen, complete named front controls, three aligned BNCs (two inputs and Trig Out), two inclined stands and reusable GLB/glTF export. Signal acquisition remains later work; see `apps/web/public/models/oscilloscope-2ch/README.md` for the model contract.
- [x] Drag/drop and click-to-place from ribbon.
- [x] Component select/move/rotate/delete; keyboard equivalents in Inspector/canvas.
- [x] Explicit logical wire/unwire, duplicate/direction/width/input-driver checks.
- [x] Zoom/pan/orbit/picking/reset/snap, with keyboard view controls.
- [x] Status-bar Zoom To Area: captured rectangle, surface-depth camera framing, reversible toolbar/wheel zoom and cancellation without graph/history edits; name-only Zoom In/Out/Fit tooltips.
- [x] Navigation UX correction: Move-only direct model dragging, Select selection, empty-surface left pan, camera-oriented XYZ and adjacent orbit/pan buttons; low-angle drag regression covered.
- [x] Selection refinement: subtle shape-following yellow contours, recessed breadboard housing and one upper-right Component Info introduction/Add panel; graph/history and Move-only drag retained.
- [x] Technical workspace refinement: 2px Medium Gold contours, real socket cavities and matching deck openings, joint/bevel clearance, selection-only Info with contained artwork, adaptive minor/major faded grid and no canvas caption. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-technical-workbench-browser.md`.
- [x] Adjacent Component Transform Gizmo: X/Z/free movement, Y rotation, hover/live wires, stable active pixel scale, obstacle avoidance, one Undo/cancel; Move-only body dragging retained. Original bench Power Supply model and no tool-title overlay. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-component-transform-gizmo-browser.md`; final bundling still limited by sandbox.
- [x] Ribbon/gizmo/supply refinement: anchored choice-only palettes, one-line Embedded/Controller, clear handles with live rotating Y grip, tall-model/small-canvas clearance, upright metal two-knob/two-post supply without USB. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-ribbon-gizmo-supply-browser.md`; unknown/OFF visual-only source boundary retained.
- [x] Undo/redo graph commands; one committed step per drag; canceled preview changes no graph.
- [x] Circuit Graph updates independent of geometry; cascade deletion and JSON round trip.
- [x] Local JSON save/open project UX in the Single Workspace (server persistence remains Phase 4).
- [x] Selected-module Inspector and local Memory Hex Editor contract.

Implemented on 2026-10-09. Evidence: `DEV_LOG.md`, `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE.md` and Phase 2 browser report. Models below provide placement/configuration contracts; simulation behavior belongs to Phase 3.
