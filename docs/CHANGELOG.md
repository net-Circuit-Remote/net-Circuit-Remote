# Changelog

All notable project changes will be documented in this file. The project follows Keep-a-Changelog-style sections and Semantic Versioning for application releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Ribbon, gizmo and upright Power Supply

- Removed ribbon Info rows; palettes follow the clicked family and clamp/update on resize/scroll. Embedded/Controller stays on one line.
- Strengthened X/Z/free/Y tool colors, strokes and backing. Y grip follows live object rotation; world movement constraints, cancellation, one Undo and Move-only body dragging remain.
- Added selected-model projection/viewport clearance using cached unposed geometry bounds.
- Replaced the supply with an upright metallic case, portrait V/A/W unknown/OFF screen, two Voltage/Ampe knobs, two recessed Vcc/Gnd sockets and an I/O switch; no USB or electrical ports. Canonical visual size and original SVG preview match the new model.
- Frontend tests 82/82 PASS, including rotating/pickable Y grip, tall/small-canvas clearance and open socket depth. See `verification/2026-10-09-ribbon-gizmo-supply-browser.md` for exact native browser/static/build evidence and limitations.

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Component Transform Gizmo

- Replaced Perspective/tool-title overlays with defined status-bar-right Zoom In/Out, Zoom To View Entire Circuit and Workspace Object Snap.
- Added adjacent X/Z/free/Y handles, hover/live wire/pose preview, stable active pixel scale, neighbor/window avoidance, captured cancellation and one Undo; body dragging stays Move-only.
- Fit now frames actual model/wire bounds. Arbitrary-angle breadboard snap uses conservative rotated footprints.
- Added original bench supply enclosure/panel/knobs/vents/terminals with unknown/OFF display and zero electrical ports.
- Final npm 79/79 and UTF-8 frontend/docs/context 17/17 PASS; native WebGL/gesture/responsive evidence recorded. Production bundle remains unverified under sandbox EPERM/prior elevation decline.

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Technical Workbench refinement

- Selection border now uses 2 CSS pixels, Medium Gold #d4af37 and camera-dependent housing contours.
- Breadboards have perforated deck/decal and real instanced socket cavities with tapered entrances/walls/floors. Shared keys have clearance; inward bevels prevent straight docking-edge overlap.
- Component Info is visible only for an existing selected model; artwork stays within its frame. Removed canvas WORKSPACE/project caption.
- Adaptive technical grid replaces uniform GridHelper with dark minors, majors every five cells, distance fade and zoom/derivative minor suppression.
- Final npm tests 68/68 PASS; WebGL/desktop verification and build sandbox limitation recorded in `verification/2026-10-09-technical-workbench-browser.md`.

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Selection contours and Component Info

- Replaced the thick emissive box cage with a subtle yellow shape contour; body colors stay unchanged. Curved model silhouette edges follow the camera within the existing render lifecycle.
- Rebuilt breadboard housing with beveled joints and recessed channels, retaining 830/630/100 visual contact instances and docking dimensions. Reduced excessive scene illumination so housing details remain readable.
- Replaced the selected-component action card and metadata-heavy Info window with one upper-right introduction panel using supplied artwork and Add +. Automatic opening preserves canvas focus/capture; Add arms placement and closing returns canvas focus. Unsupported entries cannot add a model.
- Added regression coverage for contours/materials/pose/disposal, real channel geometry, curved silhouette, unobstructed resistor contours and passive Info opening. Fixed the introduction fallback for supported Board models. Final npm tests 62/62 PASS; browser verified Add/Move/Undo/Select and four desktop sizes. Final bundling remains unverified because Vite realpath was blocked by the sandbox after build elevation was declined; an earlier build passed. Details: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_SELECTION_AND_COMPONENT_INFO.md` and `verification/2026-10-09-component-information-browser.md`.

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Move-only model dragging

- Per the latest user request, only Move permits direct dragging of breadboards and other models. Select selects without moving geometry/camera or recording history.
- Updated workspace hints/cursor and current docs. Regression tests cover Select on breadboard/LED, Move drag/Undo and cancellation when switching to Select; npm 54/54 and production build PASS. Native browser confirms Select cannot drag and Move can; see `verification/2026-10-09-move-tool-browser.md`.

### Fixed — 2026-10-09 Workspace navigation (earlier behavior)

- Initially enabled left-drag model movement in Select; superseded by the Move-only rule above. Empty-surface left drag pans freely on XZ without circuit history changes.
- XYZ directions follow camera orbit through inverse-quaternion projection. Six adjacent accessible orbit/pan buttons replace the View controls box; directional pan follows camera heading.
- Added pointer capture/4 px drag threshold, single move commit and cancellation/hidden-context cleanup. Model elevation/rotation and logical connections are preserved.
- Fixed visible-model dragging at low camera angles using the picked surface's horizontal interaction plane. Passive gizmo regions let mouse gestures reach the canvas.
- Added real editor/graph/camera regression tests, genuine right-button OrbitControls pointer integration, source analysis and browser evidence. Verification details are recorded in DEV_LOG.

### Implemented — 2026-10-09 Interactive Circuit Workspace

- Added canonical functional catalog and verified browser snapshot for 17 placeable models; supplied icons and Single Workspace architecture retained.
- Added Three.js lights/models/labels/port anchors/logical wires/picking, orbit/pan/snap/zoom/reset and context/visibility/resize lifecycle.
- Added graph-backed placement, selection, move preview/commit/cancel, rotation, cascade delete, wire/unwire and bounded Undo/Redo. Import checks unique IDs, references, geometry and local memory images; unknown types/ports are retained.
- Added selected-component Inspector, keyboard edit/wiring equivalents and local Memory Hex Editor with validated Apply/Load/Save, instance isolation and history.
- Documented optional numeric editor rotation within graph schema 1.0 and a separate memory image 1.0 contract. Structural visuals have no ports; arithmetic has no fabricated part number; physical pinouts/power and execution are not inferred.
- Fixed final-review GPU instance-buffer disposal and Escape across ribbon/port focus. Ghost models are reused during placement motion.
- Extended frontend CI paths/provenance/behavior checks. Exact verification and browser evidence are in DEV_LOG.

### Implemented — 2026-10-09 Single Workspace shell

- Replaced App's page shell with SingleWorkspaceShell. Legacy/unknown URLs redirect to `/`; deleted seven routed pages and five legacy sidebar/workspace/dock components.
- Added New/Open/Save/Undo/Redo with local schema v1 JSON, structural/size guards, independent bounded history and stale validation invalidation. Large exports use compact JSON when pretty-printing would exceed the import limit; failed exports do not mark the project saved.
- Added twelve component families using supplied artwork, seven shared tool modes, dominant Three.js grid, contextual zoom/reset controls and simulation/status/count/connection presentation.
- Added six shared floating shells with dragging, bounded reflow, z-order, explicit activation, arrow-key movement, Escape and stable ribbon focus restoration.
- Preserved typed API, WebSocket reconnect and all six store boundaries. Inspector provides real station discovery, graph validation and bounded event console.
- Generated seventeen provenance-checked SVG thumbnails: 101,749,162 source bytes → 43,482 output bytes. Canonical device-library snapshots supply available metadata.
- Added state/file/router/scene regression tests and updated frontend CI triggers/boundary checks. Exact verification is recorded in DEV_LOG; placement, execution, acquisition and memory models remain later phases.

### Changed — 2026-10-09 Single Workspace architecture

- Approved a frontend redesign from the previous six-page Web shell to a **Single Workspace** virtual-electronics workbench.
- `/` is now the target entry point for the laboratory workspace; Dashboard / Circuits / Stations / Experiments / Settings are superseded as user-facing navigation concepts.
- Approved the target UI composition: app/file bar, top component ribbon, left interaction tool rail, dominant central Three.js workspace, contextual viewport controls, bottom simulation status bar and floating tool/instrument windows.
- Approved floating Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Signal Monitor/Logic Analyzer, Component/IC Info, Inspector and Memory Hex Editor concepts.
- Updated AI instructions so future implementation follows the supplied reference images and CRUMB-like workflow inspiration without copying proprietary source/assets pixel-for-pixel.
- Reopened the frontend shell work as `single-workspace-ui-migration`; existing typed API, WebSocket and Pinia boundaries are intended to be reused.
- Marked the previous Web Foundation multi-page design/spec as **SUPERSEDED**.

### Notes

- The initial 2026-10-09 architecture update was documentation-only; the subsequent source migration is implemented as recorded above.
- Exact SDRAM, routing IC, ADC, DAC and FPGA pin mappings remain intentionally unselected.

### Historical — Phase 1 Web Foundation (superseded UI shell, reusable infrastructure retained)

The following items were implemented on 2026-10-08 and remain useful engineering history. The page/layout decisions are superseded; transport/state/test infrastructure may be reused.

- Six routed pages and the old desktop Laboratory layout.
- Six separate Pinia stores.
- Typed API client/domain services, structured validation outcomes and explicit simulation/hardware status adapter.
- Resilient event WebSocket with capped exponential reconnect, station rediscovery and lifecycle cleanup.
- Session-only circuit drafts and backend-driven station discovery/graph validation.
- Frontend runtime tests with TypeScript checking; CI uses locked dependency installation, tests, build and source boundary checks.

### Initial Scaffold

- Approved architecture baseline for Web-first development.
- Modular monorepo design.
- Raspberry Pi 5 / Vue / FastAPI / Hardware Service technology baseline.
- EP4CE6 Experiment Controller prototype direction.
- EP4CE10E22C8N + 64 MB 16-bit SDR SDRAM V1 direction.
- Hardware Station and Circuit Graph abstractions.
- AI context-drift prevention documentation workflow.
- Added Vue/Vite frontend shell and explicit Three.js workspace boundary.
- Added FastAPI application backend shell with health/station/circuit-validation endpoints.
- Added Hardware Station abstraction with Virtual/Physical implementations.
- Added starter circuit simulator and 74HC08 functional model.
- Added FPGA directory structure and compile-safe placeholder top module.
- Added Nginx/systemd/Raspberry Pi deployment templates.
- Added GitHub Actions starter workflows and integration/context checks.
- Hardened the Physical Hardware adapter so it delegates to a real driver and never fabricates successful physical operations.

### Fixed

- Reject malformed station states and preserve the selected mode when a target changes its reported mode.
- Prevent stale discovery and circuit validation responses from replacing newer state.
- Wrap long circuit names in the legacy Inspector; run context subprocess checks with the current Python executable on Windows and Linux.
- Fixed frontend TypeScript CI build configuration by adding Node.js type definitions and the `ESNext.Disposable` library required by current Vite/Rollup declarations.
