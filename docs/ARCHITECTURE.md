# net*CIRCUIT Remote Architecture

## 1. System goal

net*CIRCUIT Remote is a remote laboratory for digital electronics. Users construct experiments in a Web workspace, validate them in software, run them through a Virtual Hardware Station during early development, and later execute the same model on real logic ICs routed and measured by FPGA hardware.

## 3. Responsibility boundaries

### Frontend

Owns the **Single Workspace** UI state, workspace interaction, Circuit Graph editing, component/tool selection, floating instrument windows, status presentation and waveform rendering. It **must not** know FPGA registers, chip-select details, raw MUX addresses, Linux device paths or physical switching sequences.

The user-facing application is not a dashboard-style multi-page site. `/` opens the workbench directly. The former Dashboard / Circuits / Stations / Experiments / Settings page model is superseded and must not be extended.


### Application Backend

Owns authentication/session boundaries, Circuit Graph validation, experiment lifecycle, resource locking, storage, WebSocket coordination and high-level policy.

### Hardware Service

Owns Hardware Station discovery, capability reporting, translation from validated logical requests to hardware operations, hardware safety transitions, transport drivers and physical/virtual adapter selection.

### FPGA

Owns deterministic and timing-critical behavior: routing apply sequences, experiment clock, trigger, capture, GPIO timing, Logic Analyzer, SDRAM access and later instrument datapaths.

## 3A. Single Workspace UI architecture

The approved frontend shell is a desktop-style virtual electronics workbench inspired by the supplied reference images and CRUMB-like workflows, while keeping original code/assets/visual identity.

Primary tool rail:

```text
Select
Wire
Move
Rotate
Delete
Probe
Scope
```

Tools requiring a larger control surface open as floating windows over the workspace rather than routing to another page:

```text
Oscilloscope
Function Generator
Logic Analyzer / Signal Monitor
Component / IC Information
Properties / Inspector
Memory Hex Editor
Validation / execution status
```

The central workspace is the dominant visual area. Large permanent sidebars are avoided; information appears contextually through ribbon menus, overlays and floating windows.

### Frontend rendering layers

```text
HTML/CSS application chrome
        +
Three.js 3D circuit scene
        +
Canvas/SVG instrument plots
        +
optional scene labels
```

Electrical identity is never inferred from visual coordinates.

### Legacy UI migration

Phase 1 migration is implemented on 2026-10-09. `App.vue` renders only `SingleWorkspaceShell`; Vue Router only normalizes legacy/unknown addresses to `/`. All seven old page files and the five Library/Workspace/Inspector/Dock/LogicAnalyzer components were removed. Typed API clients, WebSocket and six stores remain reusable.

Current composition: `components/workbench/{AppTitleBar,ComponentRibbon,ToolRail,CircuitWorkspace3D,SimulationStatusBar}` and `components/windows/FloatingWindowManager`. Shared `FloatingWindow` owns drag, keyboard movement/Escape, activation/focus restoration and bounded workspace-relative placement for instruments, Inspector and Hex Editor. `ComponentInfoWindow` is the single anchored introduction panel at the upper right; it still uses the shared `ui.windows` open/z/activation state. Automatic selection opens it passively, preserving canvas focus and pointer capture; explicit ribbon Info activation focuses its header. `ui` owns ribbon/window state, `workspace` owns one active tool, and `circuit` owns local files, bounded project history and stale-validation guards. Validation and station selection live inside Inspector.

Phase 2: `three/SceneManager.ts` owns scene/camera/lights/grid/renderer, metadata-backed models, named port anchors, wire projections, ray picking and OrbitControls. `ComponentModel` owns procedural geometry/label textures and GPU disposal including instance buffers. Vue owns ResizeObserver, visibility/context/mount bridges; `useCircuitEditor` coordinates pointer capture, preview/cancel and command commit. Renders coalesce on demand; zero/hidden/lost-context scenes suspend; unmount releases frame/listener/control/GPU resources.

Current technical refinement: `BreadboardHousing` perforates deck/decal using shared `BreadboardSockets` coordinates; one InstancedMesh contains beveled socket entrances, walls and floors. Common keys have clearance and bevels remain inside nominal docking dimensions. `SelectionOutline` renders camera-dependent housing contours with LineSegments2/LineMaterial at 2 CSS pixels, Medium Gold #d4af37. Outlines follow model pose, ignore picking, retain body colors and dispose before replacement/removal. `TechnicalGrid` renders a derivative-filtered XZ plane with minor/major hierarchy, distance/focus fade and projected-pixel minor suppression in the existing RAF. Info only renders for a selected graph model; clearing/deleting selection closes it. Add + arms placement and the ordinary command commits graph/history. See `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_TECHNICAL_WORKBENCH.md`.

Navigation UX correction: only Move permits direct model dragging; Select selects without creating a move gesture or pointer capture. Empty-surface left-drag pans the XZ plane. Model motion uses a horizontal plane through the actual ray hit, retains elevation and commits once. Empty-surface pan translates camera and target by the world grab-anchor delta without editing graph/history. Right-button OrbitControls rotation updates `WorkspaceNavigator` through the same render callback: inverse camera quaternion projects the fixed world XYZ basis into SVG screen directions. Six adjacent accessible orbit/pan buttons replace the separate View controls box; button panning follows the camera's XZ heading. Passive gizmo regions pass pointer events to the canvas. See `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_WORKSPACE_NAVIGATION.md`.

`circuit` owns typed graph commands/history and rejects invalid changes before recording. Move previews geometry and commits once on release; delete cascades wires. `workspace` owns transient placement/selection/pending-port/snap state. Named IDs/functional ports define connectivity; no visual coordinate/hole/overlap does. Canonical functional catalog is `device-library/editor/components.json`, consumed through a verified generated snapshot. 74HC08 logical gates, generic arithmetic abstractions and memory do not imply confirmed package/electrical hardware mappings. The optional rotation field remains graph schema 1.0 compatible. Local memory images have a separate versioned byte contract; Hex Editor updates graph through history. Simulator execution/acquisition remain Phase 3+.

The supplied `assets/icon .svg` set currently has 20 files with large embedded PNG artwork. A reproducible script produces small SVG/WebP thumbnails with a provenance manifest and canonical starter metadata snapshots. Frontend imports remain inside `apps/web/src`; originals stay untouched. A separate standard-Python script synchronizes the functional editor catalog. Tests verify both pipelines.

The active Single Workspace UI specification is:

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-single-workspace-ui-design.md`


## 4. Hardware Station abstraction

```text
HardwareStation
├── Experiment Controller
├── Instrument Controller
├── Routing Fabric
├── Breadboard[]
├── Logic IC Resources
└── Measurement Resources
```

Software must not assume that one Hardware Station always contains exactly one FPGA. V1 uses one FPGA architecture, but future Instrument logic may migrate to a second FPGA without changing the Browser-facing model.

## 5. Virtual vs physical execution

Both execution modes follow the same conceptual API: `get_capabilities`, `validate_configuration`, `apply_circuit`, `set_input`, `configure_clock`, `configure_generator`, `configure_trigger`, `arm_capture`, `run`, `stop`, `read_capture`, `safe_state`, and `reset`.

Virtual Hardware is the default development target before FPGA integration. Physical Hardware must never silently fall back to a simulated success state when FPGA hardware is unavailable.

## 6. Circuit Graph flow

```text
Browser Circuit Graph
    -> Backend parse
    -> logical validation
    -> electrical/resource validation
    -> acquire station lock
    -> generate routing plan
    -> Hardware Service
    -> safe state
    -> apply route
    -> configure input/clock/instrument
    -> arm
    -> run/capture
    -> stop
    -> read results
    -> release station
    -> Browser
```

## 7. Control plane and data plane

### Control plane

```text
Browser -> REST/WebSocket command -> FastAPI -> Hardware Service
        -> FPGA control registers -> routing / clock / trigger
```

### Data plane

```text
Real IC / ADC -> FPGA capture -> FIFO / SDRAM -> Hardware Service
              -> Application Backend -> WebSocket binary -> Browser
```

Bulk sample data should use binary transport when appropriate rather than JSON sample-by-sample.

## 8. FPGA development path

### Prototype

`EP4CE6E22C8N`, no external SDRAM. Scope is Experiment Controller bring-up only: clock/reset, device/version registers, communication interface, GPIO, safe-state FSM, basic routing control and basic experiment clock.

### Final V1

`EP4CE10E22C8N` + **64 MB SDR SDRAM, 16-bit**. V1 remains a single-FPGA architecture, with RTL separated into Experiment Control and Instrument domains.

```text
EP4CE10
├── Experiment Control Domain
│   ├── Routing Manager
│   ├── MUX/Crosspoint Control
│   ├── GPIO
│   ├── Experiment Clock
│   └── Safety FSM
└── Instrument Domain
    ├── Trigger
    ├── Logic Analyzer
    ├── Generator
    ├── Acquisition
    ├── Capture Buffer
    └── SDRAM Controller
```

An analog oscilloscope requires an external analog front-end and ADC. An analog/arbitrary waveform generator may require DAC and output analog circuitry.

## 9. Breadboard model

A physical contact is not automatically an independent routing channel.

```text
Physical Contact -> Electrical Node -> Routing Resource
                 -> MUX/Crosspoint -> FPGA-controlled Source/Destination
```

The initial target is at least two physical breadboards. Exact independent routing capacity remains subject to routing IC choice, FPGA I/O, topology, signal integrity and electrical constraints.

## 10. Fault behavior

```text
FAULT -> stop clock -> disable generator -> safe routing -> stop capture
      -> set error -> log -> release or quarantine station
```

Fault sources include timeout, invalid route, resource conflict, disconnect, protocol mismatch, capture overflow, SDRAM error or instrument failure.

## 11. Multi-user model

Concurrent Web users do not equal concurrent independent physical experiments. The application server manages sessions, queueing, reservations and ownership; concurrency of physical experiments is bounded by actual Hardware Stations/resources.

## 12. Web-first integration gate

FPGA integration begins only after milestone **W1 — Web Platform Ready for FPGA Integration**, defined in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Component transform and view ownership — 2026-10-09

`ComponentTransformGizmo` is scene-owned and never serialized. Raycast its explicit X/Z/free/Y handles before graph geometry; Move-only direct body dragging remains. The editor previews pose/endpoints/wires, unwraps Y angles, then commits one circuit command or restores graph geometry on cancel. Screen scale is refreshed during active movement; candidate positions avoid reusable neighbor snapshots and DOM window/navigation bounds. Arbitrary-angle breadboard snap uses conservative AABB extents. `PowerSupplyModel` owns the original visual case/panel/knobs/vents/terminals; no electrical ports or live measurements are invented.

View controls belong at Status Bar right: Zoom In/Out, fit entire model/wire bounds with viewing direction retained, and Workspace Object Snap (0.5 movement, 15-degree gizmo rotation). No Perspective or generic tool-title overlay. Scene resources stay outside Pinia and dispose with SceneManager. See `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_TRANSFORM_GIZMO.md` for algorithms and verification limits.
