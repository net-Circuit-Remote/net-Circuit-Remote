# Development Log

## Current Goal

Phase 2 **Interactive Circuit Workspace** is implemented, preserving Phase 1 shell and transport boundaries. Next: Phase 3 simulator/event/clock/model adapters and real output/capture data.

## Collapsible Component Toolbar and Tools Sidebar — 2026-10-11

Added independent session-only UI flags and permanent native chevron buttons for the horizontal component ribbon and vertical tools rail. Both start expanded; Enter/Space, aria-expanded/controls and dynamic labels work. `v-show` retains toolbar DOM/scroll while removing hidden controls from layout/focus/accessibility. Ribbon collapse closes its palette and prevents hidden families opening one. Editing mode, selection, armed placement, graph, saved/history state and logical endpoints remain separate from layout.

Existing canvas ResizeObserver updates renderer/camera aspect and floating-window bounds; transient pointer previews/Zoom To Area cancel safely on resize without an edit command. Hidden instrument openers now return focus to the visible toolbar toggle. Browser found Probe overlapping the status bar at height560 after adding the fixed toggle; scoped list scrolling with min-height0/nonshrinking buttons corrected it. Toggle remains outside the scroller. Independent review found no outstanding material issue, including this fix.

Verification: two new real-store cases observed FAIL before implementation, then **frontend163/163 PASS** with production/test TypeScript checks. Final **production build PASS**, 133 modules; existing >500 kB bundle advisory. **Frontend boundary/docs/context17/17 PASS**. Browser tested four layout combinations at 1280×720, 1366×768, 1920×1080 and 390×844, plus the default compact viewport and height560. Both toggles remain in view, no horizontal document overflow; Enter/Space restore tool state, placement works while collapsed, instrument Escape returns focus correctly and resize cancels Area. Default canvas grows 632.4×442 → 660.4×511.4. Viewport overrides reset; screenshots saved. Initial stale Pinia hot reload caused one missing-action error; reload initialized new actions and no new warnings/errors appeared during subsequent verification.

Context/whitespace checks pass. npm tests/build use the previously approved external execution for sandbox realpath/loopback restrictions; no dependency changes. Backend/hardware full suites were not rerun for this UI-only task (the preceding Zoom task's97/97 result stays historical). No contract/artwork changes, commit/push/deployment.

Detailed ownership/algorithms: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_COLLAPSIBLE_TOOLBARS.md`. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-11-collapsible-toolbars-browser.md` and expanded/collapsed PNGs. Phase 3 remains the existing next task.

## Zoom To Area and concise zoom tooltips — 2026-10-11

Added the requested status-bar button immediately right of Zoom To View Entire Circuit. A temporary view mode retains the prior tool/selection, focuses the canvas and captures a rectangle before editing/picking actions. The overlay has no Three.js resources. Release frames the actual center surface, fits sampled boundary depths with retained heading/FOV/aspect, and rebases wheel/toolbar magnification to 100% like Fit. Whole-viewport selection preserves the existing pose. Graph, model root scale, endpoint identities and Undo/Redo remain untouched.

Escape/right-click/toggle, tool/placement/graph changes, viewport resize, hidden/context-lost scene and unexpected capture loss cancel. Right-button chords also cancel through contextmenu; normal capture release after a tiny drag allows retry. Tab remains available; release after invalid/zero viewport is guarded. Zoom In, Zoom Out and Zoom To View Entire Circuit titles now contain only their exact names.

Regression sequence: missing framing/state failed before implementation. Independent review reproduced a foreground center crossing the camera and right-button chord cancellation. Both were fixed; the follow-up near-horizontal edge-depth clipping was reproduced and fixed by sample-based perspective fitting. Camera tests cover default/low views, elevated models, horizon fallback, clamping/inactive/non-finite cases and wheel/toolbar reversibility. Editor tests cover priority over Move/Rotate/Delete/Wire, unchanged graph/history, reverse drag, foreign pointers, cancellation/retry and keyboard focus.

Final frontend **161/161 PASS**, production **build PASS** (133 modules; existing large-chunk advisory), whole Python repository **97/97 PASS** with three existing dependency deprecation warnings. The previously recorded artwork provenance failure no longer reproduces; this task did not edit or regenerate artwork. Sandbox loopback/realpath restrictions required approved external execution for full suites/build/server; no production dependency changes. Browser verifies final native reverse drag over Breadboard 630, retained component count, 100% reference, Escape, exact tooltips/order and layout at 1280×720, 1366×768, 1920×1080 plus the default compact viewport. Final warning/error logs are empty.

Detailed source/algorithms: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_ZOOM_TO_AREA.md`. Evidence: `verification/2026-10-11-zoom-to-area-browser.md` and PNG. No commit/push/deployment; simulator/hardware contracts unchanged. The next Phase 3 work remains the existing event/clock/model integration.

## Whole-project stability audit — 2026-10-10

Reviewed 63 TypeScript/Vue production files, 24 API/hardware/simulator Python files, procedural factories/artwork/export contracts, stylesheet/canvas sizing, repository scripts, deployment templates and the explicit RTL scaffold. Navigation does not change model root scale or graph poses. Toolbar/wheel zoom now share target-relative dolly, the existing 50–200% UI range and reported magnification; Fit resets the reference while preserving heading. Non-finite inputs, near-horizon pan jumps, finite extreme rotation overflow and captured orbit during zero-height resize are guarded. Partial scene initialization cleans up its manager.

Added keyed WireLayer reconciliation and incident-edge preview updates; unrelated wire buffers/materials and selected-wire colors survive. Supply setting commits reuse its assembly/display/outline. Docking caches footprints and rejects distant sites before collision checks (one local 400-board/10-call probe: 105.5→8.6 ms). Placement IDs use linear Set lookup. Geometry/material/all direct texture slots dispose once per owned subtree; labels own Sprite geometry; pending logo loads release removed roots and suppress callbacks. Controlled Three buffer paths returned counts to zero across 21 model cycles, and disposed roots were collected while image requests remained pending.

Combined Undo/Redo string storage is bounded at 20 MB/50 entries, retaining one immediate oversized snapshot; unreachable saved fingerprints release. Newer station events survive older discovery; cancellation is rechecked after JSON; obsolete validation aborts. Circuit/memory file reads respect request/lifecycle/module/image revisions, so newer selections/Apply/Initialize/Undo cannot be overwritten; canceled pickers support same-file reselection. Backend now follows canonical optional-field types, handles binary WS frames cleanly, rejects unsupported modes, preserves explicit driver failure flags, closes gRPC on interruption and rejects float logic levels before bitwise operations. Windows documentation tests use explicit UTF-8.

Final frontend **153/153 PASS**, production **build PASS**, Python **96 PASS / 1 FAIL**. The sole failure is supplied-icon provenance: manifest22 versus source19 while the user edits artwork. The user explicitly asked to keep their icon files; no icon regeneration/restoration or test suppression occurred. Scoped backend/hardware/simulator **53/53 PASS**, schema parity26 cases, native gRPC termination20 servers. Browser verifies real models, toolbar/wheel zoom, Fit/Orbit/grab-Pan and portrait/landscape proportions; final warning/error logs empty. Independent reviewer reproduced and rechecked four findings, with no outstanding material code finding. Existing large-bundle/dependency deprecation advisories remain. Python dependencies reside only in ignored `.audit-runtime`; no system Python changes.

Generator/scope's shared -10° visual chassis, grounded supports, root Y-up/yaw and control pivots remain verified, including existing GLB/glTF round trips; visual exports were unchanged by this lifecycle audit. Real hardware, complete simulator execution, generated RPC handlers, FPGA synthesis and long-duration browser GPU heap measurements remain untested/unimplemented boundaries. No commit/push/deployment. Detailed algorithms/findings: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_STABILITY_AUDIT.md`; browser evidence: `verification/2026-10-10-stability-audit-browser.md`.

## Ribbon, rotating grip and upright Power Supply — 2026-10-09

Removed the per-entry Info rows and entry-count jargon from ribbon menus. Palettes anchor under the triggering family, clamp within the ribbon and update on scroll/resize; keyboard focus and dismissal remain. Embedded/Controller uses intrinsic button width and stays on one line.

Gizmo has thicker coral X/blue Z arrows, an ivory framed free-move diamond and a gold arc/grip with dark backing. Its Y subgroup follows live model yaw and picking uses the real grip position; world X/Z constraints remain fixed. Unposed visual bounds prevent overly inflated projections after yaw; selected-model clearance and stronger viewport margins keep tall-model controls and small-canvas handles usable. Body drag remains Move-only, preview stays separate from graph and a gesture commits one Undo.

Replaced the squat four-knob/three-terminal supply with an upright metal case, portrait V/A/W unknown/OFF screen, two Voltage/Ampe knobs, two Vcc/Gnd binding posts, I/O switch, vents, screws and feet, without USB. Canonical/generated visual dimensions are now [2.4, 2.8, 3.2]; zero electrical ports remain. Added an original matching SVG preview and updated Component Info. Independent review found capped socket bores; a front-ray regression failed, then passed after replacing the closed base with an open cylinder/annular flange. Two user-added PNG references are untouched.

Final frontend tests **82/82 PASS**, UTF-8 frontend/docs/context **17/17 PASS**, context and diff whitespace PASS. Native browser verifies Y 0→120° with one Undo/Redo, X 0→1 with unchanged Y/Z, and free X/Z (0,0)→(0.5,0.5), all in Select via explicit handles. Five viewport measurements confirm anchored menus, single-line label and no page overflow; fresh warning/error logs are empty. Final production TypeScript PASS; Vite sandbox realpath EPERM prevents bundling and the prior elevation decline is respected. Full evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-ribbon-gizmo-supply-browser.md`; algorithms: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_RIBBON_GIZMO_SUPPLY.md`. No commit/push/deployment or hosted CI run. Earlier sections below record previous refinements.

## Component Transform Gizmo and status view tools — 2026-10-09

Removed Perspective viewport box and generic Select/Wire/Move/Rotate title/hint. Defined Zoom In/Out, Zoom To View Entire Circuit and Workspace Object Snap at Status Bar right, with responsive wrapping. Fit uses full model/wire bounds, retains heading and resets magnification. Selected objects have adjacent X/Z/free movement and Y rotation handles, hover/active color, live pose/endpoints/wires, stable screen scale including active movement, neighboring-model/window avoidance and one Undo on release. Body dragging remains Move-only; capture/Escape/tool/selection/graph/context cancellation restores committed geometry.

Added original bench supply enclosure/front controls/vents/terminals/feet/screws, unknown/OFF readouts and concise introduction; zero-port visual-only contract retained. Updated breadboard snap to conservative actual-angle footprints. Fresh independent review exposed single-use neighbor iteration and missing active scale updates; both reproduced RED and fixed GREEN.

Final npm **79/79 PASS**, UTF-8 Python frontend/docs/context **17/17 PASS**, context check and diff whitespace PASS. Browser verified native supply X drag 6→8.5 with unchanged Y/Z and one Undo/Redo; Y arc 0→75° with Undo; breadboard diamond (0,0)→(2,1.5) with Undo; fit/zoom/orbit, real supply geometry and four responsive sizes. Fresh-load warning/error logs empty; earlier stale-store HMR errors are recorded in the report. Final build passes TypeScript but sandbox Vite realpath EPERM prevents bundling; prior elevation decline respected. No dependency/contract/hardware changes, commit/push/deployment or hosted CI run. See `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_TRANSFORM_GIZMO.md` and `verification/2026-10-09-component-transform-gizmo-browser.md`.

## Technical grid, socket depth and 2px selection — 2026-10-09

Replaced native one-pixel contours with LineSegments2 screen strokes (2 CSS px, Medium Gold #d4af37) while retaining housing silhouettes and safe disposal. Replaced capped/painted socket squares with perforated deck/decal plus one instanced cavity geometry per 830/630/100 board: tapered entrance, walls and dark recessed floor. Shared contact coordinates keep openings aligned. Enlarged female-key clearances; an independent review found the remaining outward bevel overlap at straight docking edges, reproduced with a failing raycast and corrected with inward bevelOffset -0.008.

Component Info is selection-only, closes when selection disappears/placement starts/model is deleted, and contains artwork without CSS rotation. Ribbon Info respects selection. Removed WORKSPACE/project caption. TechnicalGrid replaces GridHelper with quiet minor lines, majors every five cells, projected-pixel detail suppression, distance/focus fade and light X/Z axes in the existing coalesced RAF.

Final npm **68/68 PASS** (six new RED-to-GREEN regressions); documentation/frontend/context checks **17/17 PASS**, context integrity and diff whitespace PASS. Browser verified real WebGL cavities/seams, 2px border, Add/selection clearing, artwork for all three boards, orbit/zoom and four desktop sizes; final warning/error logs empty. Production build passed TypeScript but Vite realpath is blocked by sandbox EPERM; previous build elevation decline is respected, so no final bundle claim. See `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_TECHNICAL_WORKBENCH.md` and `verification/2026-10-09-technical-workbench-browser.md`. The following sections record earlier implementations.

## Selection contours and Component Info — 2026-10-09

Latest request uses the last two reference images as design inspiration: subtle yellow contours around selected/moving models and an upper-right introduction/Add panel. Removed the twelve emissive box bars and body selection tint. `SelectionOutline` uses the actual breadboard profile; generic housing triangles are welded into adjacency edges and select camera silhouette/visible creases. One LineSegments object follows each selected model; updates run in the existing coalesced render callback. Outline resources are detached/disposed before rebuilding a model. `BreadboardHousing` now extrudes integrated joints and actual recessed channels with matched surface UVs; original dimensions and 830/630/100 contact instances remain. Scene lighting is reduced for readable cavities and edges.

Removed the old selection action card. `ComponentInfoWindow` is one anchored panel shared by scene selection and ribbon preview, with original supplied artwork, name, introduction and Add +. Selection opens without incrementing activation, preserving canvas focus and Move capture. Add arms the same known type without committing history until surface click; unknown/future entries remain disabled. Close returns canvas focus. Inspector and the tools retain editing capabilities; direct dragging still requires Move.

Regression tests reproduced the mesh cage, missing recessed geometry, reuse of disposed outlines, passive Info absence, static curved contours and occluded resistor contours before correction. Final npm suite: **62/62 PASS**; documentation/frontend/context checks **17/17 PASS**, context integrity PASS. Independent review found no Critical/Important issues; corrected its minor Board fallback and resistor-band findings (44 hidden contour samples became zero). Native browser verified Add before/after surface click, Move while Info is open, one Undo, Select refusing drag, LED information/silhouette after orbit, a single panel containing only Close/Add buttons, no legacy action card and no warning/error logs. Desktop 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1366×768 and 1280×720: panel inside workspace, above navigator, full introduction visible and no horizontal overflow. An earlier production build passed (117 modules); the final build passed TypeScript but Vite was blocked by sandbox realpath EPERM after the user rejected build elevation. Final bundling remains unverified; no new elevation was requested. Source analysis: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_SELECTION_AND_COMPONENT_INFO.md`; exact evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-component-information-browser.md` and screenshot. Earlier sections below describe historical implementations.

## Breadboard Magnetic Docking & Anti-Overlap Snapping — 2026-10-09

Resolved physical gap and overlapping issues when joining multiple breadboards (`BREADBOARD`, `BREADBOARD_630`, `BREADBOARD_100`). Implemented `snapPosition` in `useCircuitEditor.ts` featuring:
1. **Mathematical Edge-to-Edge Magnetic Docking**: Calculates exact physical docking offsets along Z (North/South: $(D_1 + D_2) / 2$) and X (West/East: $(W_1 + W_2) / 2$) with magnetic capture zones ($dZ \le 0.65, dX \le 1.5$ for Z-joints, $dX \le 0.65, dZ \le 1.2$ for X-joints). Automatically filters out already-occupied docking slots.
2. **Anti-Overlap Collision Resolution**: 3-pass AABB collision relaxation actively repels overlapping breadboards to the nearest flush boundary, preventing models from penetrating or superimposing on each other.
3. **Component Non-Interference**: Standard grid snapping remains intact for electrical components (resistors, ICs, LEDs, etc.) to allow natural placement onto breadboard surfaces.
4. **Verification**: 56/56 web unit tests passed, including dedicated test cases for BB630-to-BB630 ($Z=1.86$), BB100-to-BB630 ($Z=1.19$), BB100-to-BB100 ($Z=0.52$), side-by-side ($X=9.0$), penetration repulsion, and component transparency. Production build passed in 3.19s.

## Breadboard 630 and Power Breadboard 100 3D Models — 2026-10-09

Implemented photorealistic 3D models and high-resolution procedural textures (Anisotropy 16) for `BREADBOARD_630` (630-tie-point terminal strip: 63 cols x 10 rows A..E & F..J, center IC divider groove, dovetail joints, no power rails) and `BREADBOARD_100` (100-tie-point power bus strip: 50 cols x 2 rows in 5-hole clusters, continuous red (+) and blue (-) power lines, bold polarity indicators, modular dovetail interlocking tabs/notches). Both visual structures are registered in canonical `device-library/editor/components.json` and synchronized 1:1 with `apps/web/src/data/editorCatalog.json`. Each model utilizes exactly 1 GPU `InstancedMesh` with automated buffer disposal upon removal. Verified with pytest (11/11 PASS), npm test (55/55 PASS), and production build (PASS).

## Move-only model dragging — 2026-10-09

Latest user rule: direct mouse dragging of breadboard and every other model requires the Move button. `useCircuitEditor` now creates a model gesture only for `workspace.tool === 'move'`; Select still picks/highlights without capture or preview. Empty-surface pan, right orbit, camera-oriented XYZ and nearby navigation buttons remain. Workspace help/hints and grab cursor match the active tool. Inspector coordinate edits and keyboard movement retain their existing behavior.

TDD evidence: the new Select regression failed before the guard change because a breadboard preview moved to X=1.5/Z=1. After correction, **npm 54/54 PASS**, including Select breadboard/LED geometry/camera/history invariants, Move preview/commit/Undo/Redo, low-angle dragging and Move-to-Select cancellation. **Production build PASS** (113 modules; existing Vite chunk advisory). Native browser: the same breadboard drag leaves X=1.5/Y=0/Z=1.5 in Select, moves to X=3/Y=0/Z=2.5 in Move, and one Undo restores the original pose; three components/one named wire remain. Browser warning/error logs are empty. See `verification/2026-10-09-move-tool-browser.md` and screenshot.

Current README/architecture/context/roadmap/spec/analysis/changelog/manifest reflect Move-only. Earlier navigation results below are historical and describe the superseded Select drag behavior.

## Historical workspace navigation correction — 2026-10-09

User requested direct left-drag pan/model movement and camera-oriented XYZ with adjacent navigation controls. Root causes: OrbitControls LEFT disabled without editor pan handler, model gesture gated on Move tool, and static SVG independent of camera. Source/algorithm analysis across frontend graph/render/transport and backend/simulator/hardware boundaries is in `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_WORKSPACE_NAVIGATION.md`.

Default Select and Move now left-drag any model, including Breadboard/Board; empty-surface left-drag grabs/pans the XZ plane. A 4 px threshold distinguishes click/jitter from drag. Model previews preserve elevation/rotation/endpoints and commit one history command on release. Pan translates camera/target only, retains selection/pending wire and records no graph history. Capture identity/release/cancel and camera input lock respect hidden/context loss. Wire/Rotate/Delete/instrument click meanings remain intact.

`WorkspaceNavigator` replaces View controls and the static axis. It projects fixed world bases through inverse camera quaternion, sorts depth and updates in the existing render callback. Six accessible local SVG buttons sit beside XYZ; pan buttons follow camera XZ heading. Passive gizmo regions pass events to the canvas.

Fresh read-only review found one Important low-camera case and one Minor overlay issue. A visible model could be picked while its ray missed Y=0; moves now intersect a horizontal plane through the actual hit, preserving module Y. A regression was RED with the old ground gate and GREEN after correction. Navigator root ignores pointer events; actual buttons receive them, with browser hit-test confirmation.

Verification: **npm 53/53 PASS**, **production build PASS** (113 modules); **full Python 56/56 PASS** with three existing dependency deprecations; `check_context.py` and `git diff --check` PASS. Existing Vite chunk-size advisory remains. Native browser verified Select breadboard/switch dragging, diagonal pan before/after orbit, connected wires, single Undo/Redo, XYZ update, six buttons and four desktop sizes (1920×1080, 1440×900, 1366×768, 1280×720), with no overflow/hint overlap and no warning/error logs. Right-button rotation is verified with genuine OrbitControls pointer-sequence/render integration; CUA native right-drag is unavailable and is not claimed. Exact evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-workspace-navigation-browser.md` and screenshot.

Updated current README/architecture/context/roadmap/spec/analysis/changelog/manifest; historical browser reports retained. No dependency/contract/driver changes, commit/push/deployment or hosted CI run. Phase 3 remains next.

## Phase 2 source and behavior — 2026-10-09

Deep source analysis: `SOURCE_ANALYSIS_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE.md`. Added canonical functional catalog and verified browser snapshot for 17 placeable types. 74HC08 uses logical gate port metadata; generic Adder/Multiplier have no part number. Breadboard/Board/Power supply visuals have no ports. Local memory image v1.0 is a separate 8-bit byte contract (1–256 bytes, explicit 32-zero-byte initialization), not physical RAM/capture.

SceneManager now owns lights/models/labels/port anchors/wire projection/picking and OrbitControls. Visual world XZ placement/Y elevation and yaw rotation stay separate from endpoints. Requests coalesce via RAF, pause for zero size/hidden/context loss, and dispose all frame/listener/control/GPU resources on unmount. Ghosts are reused while moving and release instance buffers when canceled.

Ribbon supports native drag/drop and click-to-place. Commands implement select/move/rotate/delete/wire/unwire/snap/undo/redo. Move previews geometry then records one history step on release; cancellation restores graph geometry. Delete cascades incident edges; Undo restores both. Failed/no-op edits do not change history or validation. Connections use explicit named ports and reject duplicate edges, wrong direction/width and additional input drivers, while allowing fanout. Unknown imported metadata is retained; guards reject duplicate IDs, dangling module references, malformed geometry/memory before mutation.

Inspector supports selected-module coordinates/rotation/metadata configuration, keyboard placement/selection/connect/disconnect, existing project/station/validation/console. Hex Editor Apply/Load/Save and Undo/Redo operate on local graph images; asynchronous load verifies draft/selection again before mutation. Run/Stop/Step and instrument acquisition/output remain unavailable until execution contracts exist.

## Phase 2 verification and review

- Baseline: npm 31/31 outside sandbox. New graph/catalog/memory/scene interfaces were RED before implementation, then GREEN.
- Final-review regressions: InstancedMesh disposal and ghost identity reproduced RED; corrected. Palette/DOM-port Escape reproduced RED in browser; shared capture handler corrected both focus paths while preserving floating-window closure.
- Final frontend suite: **43/43 PASS**; production build **PASS**. Full Python regression: **56/56 PASS**, including canonical editor provenance and memory schema; three existing dependency warnings. `check_context.py` PASS. Exact final evidence: `verification/2026-10-09-interactive-workspace-browser.md`.
- Browser verified native breadboard drag/drop, switch/LED placement and wiring, Move with exactly one Undo, rotation, unwire/delete cascade/restore, JSON Save/New/Open preserving rotation/edges/memory, valid/invalid Hex Apply and Undo/Redo.
- All 17 model families rendered/configured; functional 74HC08 and 8-bit memory/display connections succeed, width mismatch fails without adding a wire. Graph structural validation and WebSocket remain connected.
- Browser pointer precision prompted a wire picking-margin regression (RED → fix). Invisible line targets use a camera-scaled margin while displayed wire geometry and graph endpoints remain unchanged.
- Responsive: 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1366×768, 1280×720 PASS; no horizontal body overflow and both open floating windows stay inside workspace. No browser warning/error logs in the tested session.
- Build and final repository/context checks are recorded in the Phase 2 browser report. CI workflow paths include memory/catalog changes; no hosted CI run or push is claimed.

Ruling: keep one demand-driven RAF rendering path without damping/animation because Phase 2 has no simulation engine; Phase 3 may extend scheduling for real signals. Use functional catalog defaults as local configuration, not physical ratings. Keep graph schema 1.0: optional rotation was already accepted by the extensible module schema and is now explicitly typed. Retain unknown imports with fallback visuals instead of inventing mappings.

One fresh read-only final reviewer found two Important issues, both reproduced and fixed as described above; no Critical/Minor findings were reported. No commit/push/deployment was requested or performed.

## Historical Phase 1 record

The following migration evidence describes the earlier shell-only state, before the Phase 2 implementation above.

## Source analysis and migration

The actual source/contracts/tests/CI and supplied icon directory were analyzed in this session. Detailed findings: `docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS_SINGLE_WORKSPACE.md`. The earlier docs-only redesign identified the six-page routed UI; that diagnosis is now historical.

`App.vue` renders only SingleWorkspaceShell. Legacy and unknown URLs normalize to `/`; router state never selects a lab workflow. Removed seven page components and five old permanent-library/workspace/inspector/dock/analyzer components. New composition:

```text
App/File Bar: New / Open / Save / Undo / Redo
Component Ribbon: twelve specified families
Tool Rail: Select / Wire / Move / Rotate / Delete / Scope / Probe
Dominant Three.js grid + contextual zoom/reset
Status Bar: execution/state/mode/timing/counts/connection
Shared FloatingWindowManager: six contextual window shells
```

Local JSON files obey schema v1 and a shared 2 MB UTF-8 limit. Export falls back to compact serialization before rejecting oversized content; failed export does not mark saved. History retains 50 independent project snapshots. Stale validation guards remain. Session drafts are not server persistence.

`ui` centralizes ribbon/window placement, focus activation and z-order; `workspace` owns exactly one tool; `instrument` keeps configuration shells and bounded event console. Station selection, refresh and structural validation are in Inspector. Existing typed REST and resilient WebSocket implementations remain unchanged.

SceneManager owns graphics, not logical state. ResizeObserver bridges host size and window bounds. Coalesced rendering, pending-frame cancellation, grid geometry/material disposal, renderer disposal and context-recovery listeners establish the Three.js lifecycle foundation.

## Icon and metadata audit

Seventeen supplied SVG files embed PNGs (101,749,162 bytes total). `scripts/prepare_workbench_icons.py` creates committed SVG/WebP thumbnails (43,482 bytes), records original SHA-256 and byte counts, and snapshots canonical starter device metadata. Originals are unchanged. All visible ribbon images loaded in browser verification. Pinouts and electrical parameters are never inferred from images.

## Verification — 2026-10-09

| Check | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Baseline frontend | 20/20 PASS before source changes, outside Windows sandbox. |
| New state/scene/file/router tests | RED missing interfaces/lifecycle → GREEN 28/28. |
| Final review regressions | Focus activation and near-limit file round trip reproduced RED; fixes → npm test 31/31 PASS. |
| Production build | `npm run build` PASS. Vite advisory: large Three.js/application chunk; no build error. |
| Frontend boundaries | `python -m pytest -q tests/frontend`: 9/9 PASS. |
| Whole repository regression | `python -m pytest -q tests services/api/tests services/hardware-service/tests simulator/circuit-simulator/tests`: 44/44 PASS. Existing 3 dependency deprecation warnings. |
| Browser | PASS at 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1366×768, 1280×720. No body horizontal overflow; workspace remains dominant; open windows stay within bounds. |
| Live integration | FastAPI simulation discovery, WebSocket connection/reconnect and Inspector graph validation verified in browser. |
| Commands/windows | New/Open/Save/Undo/Redo, malformed file rejection, supplied icons, tools/zoom, all six window shells, pointer drag/clamp, keyboard movement/Escape, repeated activation and stable focus restoration verified. |
| CI | Frontend workflow triggers updated for artwork/device metadata/script changes. Local workflow checks PASS; no hosted run is claimed before push. |

Browser details: `docs/verification/2026-10-09-single-workspace-browser.md`. Windows sandbox prevents loopback HTTP tests and Vite realpath; the actual verification commands were rerun with approved execution outside it.

## Independent final review

One read-only reviewer found two material issues: ribbon opener focus loss/reselection and pretty exports exceeding the import size limit. Both were reproduced and fixed with regression evidence; final npm suite has 31 passing tests. No additional material defect was identified in import-before-mutation, stale validation, bounds, scene disposal or original-asset exclusion. No minor findings were deferred by the reviewer.

Scope retained: editing/execution/capture are explicit Phase 2+ features; the router's no-op record serves address compatibility only; permissive module properties follow the canonical schema. Costs of these choices are later editor/model/API work, a small temporary compatibility dependency, and leaving logical/electrical validation to the backend. No contract changes or physical driver work occurred.

## Architectural decisions still locked

- Raspberry Pi 5 is the V1 main controller; Web-first / simulation-first.
- Single Workspace is the frontend UX architecture.
- EP4CE6E22C8N without SDRAM is the Experiment Controller prototype.
- EP4CE10E22C8N + 64 MB 16-bit SDR SDRAM is the V1 final direction.
- One FPGA; at least two physical breadboards.
- Physical holes/visual coordinates do not imply independent routing channels or electrical nodes.
- Frontend never imports hardware drivers or accesses device registers directly.

## Historical Phase 1 limitations

Phase 1 provides the shell/grid; it does not place, pick, render or wire logical modules. Tools select an editor mode, not a completed graph-edit action. Run/Stop/Step, acquisition/output, waveform measurements and supported memory editing are unavailable until real contracts/models exist. Projects remain local to the session unless downloaded. Window resizing/minimizing is future work. Vite's large-chunk advisory remains non-blocking.

Device-library coverage is small. gRPC generated bindings/handlers, exact SDRAM/timing, routing architecture/channel count, ADC/DAC/AFE and physical execution remain unimplemented/unselected.

## AI Handoff

### What changed

Latest task adds temporary Zoom To Area rectangle framing and concise zoom titles; see the 2026-10-11 entry and SOURCE_ANALYSIS_ZOOM_TO_AREA. Source/build/frontend/Python verification passed. Preserve the previous graph/history/geometry and hardware boundaries.

Phase 2 canonical catalog, separate memory contract, graph command/history layer, scene/models/picking/wires/camera controls, pointer/drag/keyboard interactions, selected Inspector/Hex Editor, lifecycle fixes, tests and Markdown. Preserve historical specs/verification and supplied artwork/axis gizmo.

### Next recommended task

Phase 3: define event-driven simulation and clock, functional catalog/evaluator adapters, output/measurement delivery and memory runtime semantics. Do not treat structural API approval, geometry, local initial bytes or visual sources as execution/electrical truth.

### Required context

Read CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, this log, SOURCE_ANALYSIS_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE, Phase 2 spec/plan/browser report, canonical editor/memory contracts and related source/tests. Current limitations: simulation/acquisition/generator output and persistence remain unimplemented; active/controller/notation and dual/quad segment contracts remain pending; physical datasheets/topology/ratings remain unconfirmed. Vite's existing large-chunk advisory is nonblocking.
