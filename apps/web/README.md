# Web Frontend — Interactive Single Workspace

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Three.js for **net*CIRCUIT Remote**. Phase 1 shell and Phase 2 interactive editor implemented on 2026-10-09. `/` opens the workbench; compatibility URLs redirect there. See [Phase 2 source analysis](../../docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE.md), [DEV_LOG](../../docs/DEV_LOG.md) and [browser evidence](../../docs/verification/2026-10-09-interactive-workspace-browser.md).

## Run and verify

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

From repository root: `python -m pytest -q tests/frontend`. Node 22 is the CI baseline. `npm run dev` starts the frontend only. Vite proxies `/api` and `/ws` to `127.0.0.1:8000`; keep FastAPI running in another terminal using the [API startup instructions, including Windows PowerShell](../../services/api/README.md#local-run). If Vite reports `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8000`, the API is not listening on its configured port. Local graph editing works without backend; structural validation, station discovery and connection state require it. Optional `VITE_API_BASE_URL` / `VITE_WS_URL` configure deployed endpoints.

## Editor controls

| Surface | Behavior |
|---|---|
| New / Open / Save | Independent session drafts; schema 1.0 JSON download/import; shared 2 MB UTF-8 limit. Imports check geometry, unique IDs, module references and local memory images before mutation. |
| Undo / Redo | Last 50 project/graph command snapshots. One move gesture commits one step. Failed/no-op commands preserve history. |
| Ribbon | Twelve families with SVG artwork. Drag a supported component to the surface, or click it then click the surface. Oscilloscope and Function Generator place two-channel bench models; Signal Monitor opens a window. Unsupported entries report model unavailable. |
| Select | Click a module/wire to select it; dragging its body does not move it or the camera. Explicit gizmo handles manipulate selection. Left drag empty surface pans. Inventory/Inspector provide keyboard selection. |
| Move | The only tool that permits direct model dragging, including Breadboard/Board: preview geometry and connected wires; release commits one position command. Cancel restores graph geometry. Click/jitter below 4 px creates no move/history. |
| Rotate / Delete | Click a module; Rotate adds 90°. Delete cascades connected edges. Delete also removes a picked wire. |
| Wire | Click two named logical ports; pending source is highlighted. Inspector offers Source/Destination selectors and Disconnect. |
| View | Left drag empty surface pans XZ; right drag orbits; middle drag pans; wheel dollies. Camera-oriented XYZ with six adjacent orbit/pan buttons remains. Zoom In/Out and Zoom To View Entire Circuit are at status-bar right. Fit frames models/wires and preserves heading. No Perspective box or generic tool-title hint. |
| Component Transform Gizmo | Adjacent X/Z arrows, free X/Z diamond and Y arc. Hover highlights; captured drag previews pose/ports/wires, release commits one Undo, Escape cancels. Height is preserved. No Delete/Confirm/Check. |
| Workspace Object Snap | Status-bar checkbox aligns placement/movement to 0.5-unit spacing, docks breadboards during free movement and rounds gizmo rotation to 15°. Off allows fine movement/continuous rotation. No electrical nets arise from geometry. |
| Component Info | Opens at the upper right only for an existing selected model, with contained artwork, name, introduction and Add +. Clearing selection, starting placement or removing that model hides the panel. Add arms the same supported type; click the surface to commit placement. Future/imported unknown models cannot be added. The panel has no edit/delete/pinout actions. Closing returns focus to the canvas. |
| Inspector | Add at origin, select, edit coordinates/rotation/metadata parameters, connect/disconnect, project/session, backend validation, station target, console. |
| Hex Editor | Select generic MEMORY; edit initial bytes, load/save image JSON, Apply and Undo/Redo. Memory v1.0: 8-bit words, 1–256 bytes; new instance explicitly starts with 32 zero bytes. |
| Scope / Probe tools | Select a graph component and open an instrument shell. Acquisition is not connected. |
| Status bar | Actual graph counts, experiment state/mode, five station states and right-aligned view tools with accessible definitions. Wraps when needed. Execution/timing remain unavailable until their contracts exist. |

Canvas keyboard: R rotates, Delete/Backspace removes selection, arrow keys move by snap step (0.1 with snap off). Escape cancels placement, wiring and move preview even when focus is on ribbon/DOM ports; floating-window Escape still closes the window. Ctrl/Meta+N/O/S/Z, Shift+Z/Y work outside form fields. Instrument/Inspector/Hex Editor headers support arrow movement and focus restoration; Component Info is anchored at the upper right.

Projects remain session-local. Save before reload/closing; no server persistence yet. Geometry, overlap, snap and decorative breadboard contacts never create electrical connectivity. API structural validation does not imply electrical approval or execution support.

Navigation correction: see [algorithm/source analysis](../../docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS_WORKSPACE_NAVIGATION.md) and [current Move-only browser evidence](../../docs/verification/2026-10-09-move-tool-browser.md). With Move selected, model dragging uses a horizontal plane through the picked surface, so a visible model remains draggable near a low camera. Its stored Y elevation, rotation and named connections stay intact. Pan changes camera/target only, retains selection/pending wire while dragging and records no circuit history; a blank click clears selection. During left gestures, other camera input is locked until release/cancel. Escape, tool/graph changes, hidden tabs and context loss cancel model previews.

## Models and contracts

The canonical editor catalog covers 21 types: Breadboard 830/630/100, Board/Power supply visuals; Resistor/Capacitor; Push button/Toggle/DIP/Clock; LED/7-segment/Display/Probe; 74HC08; generic Adder/Multiplier; generic Memory; two-channel Oscilloscope and Function Generator visuals.

**Function Generator 2 CH:** Instruments places the reference-based L1571979 silver model with a charcoal front. Its left screen contains yellow CH1 sine/cyan CH2 square previews and five parameters per channel. Six illuminated screen keys, a 3×3 function keypad, centered encoder/LED arc, arrow keys, three colored BNCs, round power key and inclined bail complete the front. The screen, controls, connectors and stand are separate named objects. Move/Rotate/gizmo/Undo-Redo use the existing lifecycle. Display artwork is illustrative; DDS output/control is not connected. See the [GLB](public/models/function-generator-2ch/function-generator-2ch.glb) and [model/export contract](public/models/function-generator-2ch/README.md). `npm run export:generator` regenerates GLB/glTF/bin/PNG/SVG; `/function-generator-preview.html` verifies the actual GLB and CanvasTexture replacement.

**Oscilloscope 2 CH:** Instruments places a silver industrial bench model with a charcoal front, a wide independent waveform screen, seven centered knob pivots and two inclined front stands. Horizontal includes Time/Div, Position and Auto Set/Run-Stop/Single/Default; Trigger includes Level and Mode/Source/Slope/Menu; each Vertical channel has Volts/Div and Position. A separate power button/LED and three aligned BNCs (CH1, CH2, Trig Out) complete the front. It uses the same scene/graph/gizmo lifecycle as other components. Waveforms are illustrative; acquisition/control behavior is not connected. Self-contained [GLB](public/models/oscilloscope-2ch/oscilloscope-2ch.glb), [glTF](public/models/oscilloscope-2ch/oscilloscope-2ch.gltf) and [coordinate/export contract](public/models/oscilloscope-2ch/README.md) are committed. `/oscilloscope-preview.html` loads that GLB for front/angled comparison and CanvasTexture verification. The Scope tool still opens the acquisition window shell.

Breadboard housing has a beveled footprint, recessed terminal/rail channels and real socket cavities with tapered entrances, walls and dark floors. Deck/decal perforations share coordinates with the 830/630/100 instances. Common mating keys have clearance; bevels stay within catalog docking bounds. Selection uses a **2 CSS px Medium Gold (#d4af37)** contour without tinting the body; curved silhouettes update with the camera. The adaptive technical grid has dark minor lines, major lines every five cells, distance fade and zoom-based minor suppression. Canvas caption is removed. Details: [current source analysis](../../docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS_TECHNICAL_WORKBENCH.md), [browser report](../../docs/verification/2026-10-09-technical-workbench-browser.md). Earlier selection reports are historical.

Structures, power-supply, Oscilloscope and Function Generator visuals have no electrical ports. 74HC08 ports A1/B1/Y1 through A4/B4/Y4 represent functional gates, not package pin numbers. Generic arithmetic uses explicit 8-bit operands, without unconfirmed part numbers. Memory's local byte contract is separate from SDRAM hardware or capture. Passive/clock defaults are model configuration, not device ratings. Outputs display their housing without fabricated signal readings.

Unknown imported types/properties/port names are retained and exposed via Inspector; unknown geometry uses a fallback model and unknown anchors are not invented. Future Active/Controller/Notation and dual/quad display entries still await metadata/model contracts.

## Ownership and lifecycle

```text
App.vue -> SingleWorkspaceShell
  ComponentRibbon / ToolRail / CircuitWorkspace3D / shared floating windows
  useCircuitEditor -> circuit command/history store
  SceneManager -> ComponentModel + logical wire geometry + picking + OrbitControls
```

Six stores remain separate: circuit (serializable graph/files/history/validation), workspace (tool/selection/pending/snap/zoom), station, experiment, instrument, ui. Scene resources stay outside Pinia. Render requests coalesce into RAF when graph/camera/gesture changes. Zero-sized/hidden/context-lost scenes pause; resize/context restore redraw. Unmount disposes observers/listeners/controls/frames/GPU geometry/material/texture/instance buffers. Floating-window layout/focus still uses Phase 1's shared manager.

The 2026-10-10 stability audit unifies wheel/toolbar dolly at 50–200%, synchronizes displayed zoom and preserves model root scale/poses. Captured orbit is disabled at zero viewport size; near-horizon pan and non-finite inputs are guarded. Wires reconcile by endpoint pair and only incident edges update on a preview. Supply setting commits retain their assembly/display texture. Shared resources dispose once, labels own their geometry and pending logos cannot retain deleted models.

Combined Undo/Redo snapshots are limited to 20 MB/50 entries, retaining one immediate oversized snapshot. Cancellation and station/file/module revisions prevent stale completions; obsolete graph validation aborts. Final frontend153/153 and production build pass. Whole Python96/97: the sole icon provenance failure is left visible while the user edits artwork, per their instruction. Algorithm details and test boundaries: [stability audit](../../docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS_STABILITY_AUDIT.md), [browser evidence](../../docs/verification/2026-10-10-stability-audit-browser.md).

## Metadata and supplied icons

Original artwork stays in `assets/icon .svg`. Frontend uses small committed SVG/WebP derivatives with source SHA-256/size provenance in `src/assets/icons/manifest.json`; no original PNG payload is bundled. Action glyphs remain local stroke SVGs. The original derivative manifest covers 22 icons; the authored `oscilloscope_2ch.svg` and `function_generator_2ch.svg` previews are generated by their model export scripts and retained by the supplied-icon refresh script.

```bash
# Python + Pillow, after changing supplied artwork or starter device metadata
python scripts/prepare_workbench_icons.py
# Standard Python, after changing functional editor metadata
python scripts/sync_editor_catalog.py
```

Commit generated files. Normal npm builds need no Python/Pillow. Frontend tests compare canonical metadata snapshots and icon provenance. Artwork alone establishes no electrical pinout.

Typed API/WebSocket layers are retained: requests stay centralized, reconnect refreshes station discovery, and physical-offline selection never silently becomes simulation. Next: Phase 3 simulator/event/clock/model adapters and real output/capture data. Hosted CI runs after push; no hosted run is claimed for local changes. Three.js still produces Vite's existing large-chunk advisory.
